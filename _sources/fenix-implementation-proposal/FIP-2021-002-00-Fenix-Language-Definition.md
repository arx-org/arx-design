## Abstract

This proposal aims to define the structure for the Fenix Language. As it would
be very long, it is divided into sections. Each section would have it own file.
Each section aims to define a specific topic.

## Motivation

After using a bunch of programming languages, it is easy to identify positive
points and negative points for each one. A programming language should be
easy, simple and flexible to use, and the result should be performatic and
resolve the problems that it was designed for. At the same time, the
programming language should helps to handle easily machine resources
(e.g. memory).

...

## Proposal

This proposal is divided in the following sections (each one in its specific
file):

- [FIP-2021-002-01 Convention](FIP-2021-002-01-Convention.md)
- [FIP-2021-002-02 Import](FIP-2021-002-02-Import.md)
- [FIP-2021-002-03 Classes](FIP-2021-002-03-Classes.md)
