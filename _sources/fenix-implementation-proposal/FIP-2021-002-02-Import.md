notes:
- If you want to import a package you can use just `import`
- Built-in modules and functions should be imported explicitly from
  `__core__`.
- If you want to import a function, variable or class from a module or
  a module from a package, you need to do it explicitly using
  `import/from` statement. It is similar to TypeScript.
