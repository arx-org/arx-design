# Programming language references

The aim for this section is to compile a high level information about how other
languages define their structures such as variables definition, import external
libraries, if and loop controle structure, etc.


## Languages used as reference

The programming language used for references are:

- C++
- C#
- Go
- Godot
- Java
- JavaScript
- Julia
- PHP
- Python
- R
- Rust
- TypeScript

### Features of Interesting

The features of interesting for this analysis are:

- code style conventions
- type annotations
- variables (constant and mutable)
- scalar types
- tuples, lists, arrays, set and dictionaries types
- pointers and references
- ownership
- conditional control (if, else if, else, switch, case, etc)
- loop control (while, do while, for, for each, list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, etc)
- functions
- lambda functions
- templates
- macros
- classes/types/structs
- enums
- import/include
- namespaces
- scope
- compilation modifier attributes
- code injection
- concurrency
- context manager
- integration with other languages
- package management
