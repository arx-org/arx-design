# Variables


This chapter will present how different languages implements variables (in high level), their rules and conventions.

Points of interesting:

- variable name
- type annotation/declaration
- constant and mutable variables

Finally, a example is presented to illustrate how the variable should be created for each programming language.


## C++

### Variable name

In **C++**, the variable name should be a valid **C++** indentifier.

According to [cplusplus.com][cplusplus-variables]

> A valid identifier is a sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). Spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols cannot be part of an identifier. In addition, identifiers shall always begin with a letter. They can also begin with an underline character (_), but such identifiers are -on most cases- considered reserved for compiler-specific keywords or external identifiers, as well as identifiers containing two successive underscore characters anywhere. In no case can they begin with a digit.
>
> C++ uses a number of keywords to identify operations and data descriptions; therefore, identifiers created by a programmer cannot match these keywords. The standard reserved keywords that cannot be used for programmer created identifiers are:
>
> alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class, compl, const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum, explicit, export, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept, not, not_eq, nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short, signed, sizeof, static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, try, typedef, typeid, typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq

Another point important here is that C++ language is a "case sensitive" language, so an identifier written in capital letters is not equivalent to another one with the same name but written in small letters.

C++ doesn't have strict naming convention, instead there is some recomendations that can be checked at the [C++ Core Guidelines][isocpp-naming]. These are the current points mentioned by this guideline:

Naming and layout rules:

- NL.1: Don’t say in comments what can be clearly stated in code
- NL.2: State intent in comments
- NL.3: Keep comments crisp
- NL.4: Maintain a consistent indentation style
- NL.5: Avoid encoding type information in names
- NL.7: Make the length of a name roughly proportional to the length of its scope
- NL.8: Use a consistent naming style
- NL.9: Use ALL_CAPS for macro names only
- NL.10: Prefer underscore_style names
- NL.11: Make literals readable
- NL.15: Use spaces sparingly
- NL.16: Use a conventional class member declaration order
- NL.17: Use K&R-derived layout
- NL.18: Use C++-style declarator layout
- NL.19: Avoid names that are easily misread
- NL.20: Don’t place two statements on the same line
- NL.21: Declare one name (only) per declaration
- NL.25: Don’t use void as an argument type
- NL.26: Use conventional const notation
